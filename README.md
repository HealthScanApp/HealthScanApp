This capstone project was created in response to the increasingly troubling health issues resulting from the consumption of unhealthy processed foods. In an age where convenience often takes precedence over nutritional value, the proliferation of preservatives and harmful substances in food, especially junk food, has caused detrimental impacts on public health. This includes the accumulation of fat and calories, which significantly contributes to the onset of obesity and various related diseases.
